My name is Yang Xiao. You can all me Swag if you prefer. My research interests are System for ML and Distributed Computing. I’m an MSc student in [Nanyang Technological University (NTU)](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/Pages/home.aspx). Before that, I was a backend software develop engineer in China Mobile.

I’m actively seeking for a PhD position.



Research
======
My current research mainly focus on large scale machine learning system, Distributed Computing and High Performance Computing. One recent interest is designing higher efficiency ML serving systems. In addition, I’m highly interested in many other related areas like Distributed Machine Learning and Federated Learning. I am always happy to chat with others about interesting research ideas, and looking for academic collaborations. Please drop me an email if you are interested in collaborating with me.
